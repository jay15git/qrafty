// Base UI variant of the gradient picker.
//
// Mirrors `registry/new-york/ui/fill-picker/gradient-picker.tsx`'s public
// surface. Only the parts that touch Radix/shadcn primitives directly are
// rewritten on Base UI:
//   - TypeSwitcher, InterpSwitcher, RadialSizeSelect → Select
//   - ReverseStops                                   → plain button
//   - StopList                                       → plain button (+
//     the shared field shell), re-exported from the original (see
//     stop-list.tsx for why)
//   - the per-stop color editor → ./parts/gradient/stop-editor, injected
//     below through the `stopEditor` slot. Both `<Bar editOnClick>` and
//     `<StopList>` rows read that slot instead of importing an editor, so
//     they stay dialect-free and open *this* variant's editor here.
//
// Everything else (Root/context, Bar, Area, Overlay, ShapeSwitcher, the
// pad/input/group parts, StopColor, Presets, CssInput, RepeatingToggle) is
// pure pointer/canvas logic or plain markup with zero Radix dependency, so
// it's imported straight from the original — a single source of truth for
// engine fixes.

// The gradient context surface, re-exported so the barrel is a complete
// entry point for anyone composing custom gradient parts (a part needs
// `useGradientPickerContext` to read state, and `GradientStopEditor*` to
// fill the stop-editor slot). This also keeps the barrel self-consistent
// with how the shadcn CLI rewrites installed imports: its import-fixup pass
// resolves an aliased specifier by file BASENAME and prefers a `.tsx`
// candidate over a `.ts` one, so `.../fill-picker/contexts/gradient.ts`
// gets redirected to this file (`fill-picker-base/gradient.tsx`) in a
// consumer project. Export-from specifiers are exempt from that pass, so
// the re-exports below stay pointed at the real module.
//
// Cycle invariant: because of that same redirect, an INSTALLED consumer's
// sibling parts (`./parts/gradient/{type,interp}-switcher`,
// `radial-size-select`, `stop-editor`, and `./fill`) import their context
// from *this barrel* rather than from `contexts/gradient` — and this barrel
// imports those parts back. That module cycle is benign only because every
// redirected binding is referenced inside a component body / hook call at
// render time, never at module-eval time: by the time anything reads
// `useGradientPickerContext`, both halves of the cycle have finished
// evaluating. Keep new module-scope evaluation out of the base gradient
// parts — a top-level `const x = useGradientPickerContext` or a
// `Context.Provider` captured into a module constant would read a
// still-uninitialized binding and blow up in consumer projects while
// staying green in this repo (where TypeScript resolves the honest path
// and there is no cycle at all). The build's basename-collision lint
// guards the export side of this; nothing can guard the eval side but
// this comment.
